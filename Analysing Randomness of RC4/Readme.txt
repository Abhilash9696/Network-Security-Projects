The objective of this assignment is to do some simple cryptanalysis of the RC4 encryption algorithm. RC4
is a stream cipher, internally generating a stream of random bits which is then XOR-ed with the plaintext.
You can simply run the program to display the graph which tells us about the raandomness of rc4.
The report contains more detailed analysis of the graph obtained.
